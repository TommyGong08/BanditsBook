# Code to Accompany the Book "Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization"


This repo contains code in several languages that implements several standard algorithms for solving the Multi-Armed Bandits Problem, including:

* epsilon-Greedy
* UCB1
* ETC


# Languages

##  Requirement
- python 3.6  


# Getting Started

To try out this code, you can go into the Python directories and then run the demo script.

In Python, that looks like:

    python task.py

You should step through that code line-by-line to understand what the functions are doing. The book provides more in-depth explanations of how the algorithms work.

The Ruby code was contributed by Kashif Rasul. If you're interested in translating the code into another language, please submit a pull request. I will merge any new implementations as soon as I can.

# How To Adding New Algorithms: API Expectations

All the algorithms are written in **bandit.py**. 
The parent class is **Bandit()** and if you would like to test your own algorithms, please written a new class inherited the parent class.  

#### For example
```python

class Bandit:
    def __init__(self, k_arm=10, initial=0., step_size=0.1, sample_averages=False):
        self.k = k_arm
        self.step_size = step_size
        self.sample_averages = sample_averages 
        self.indices = np.arange(self.k) 
        self.initial = initial  

    def step(self):
        ...

class Epsilon_Greedy(Bandit):
    def __init__(self, k_arm=10, epsilon=0., initial=0., step_size=0.1, sample_averages=False):
        Bandit.__init__(k_arm, initial, step_size, sample_averages)
        self.epsilon = epsilon  

    def act(self):
        ...
```


# Reference
In R, there is a body of code for visualizing the results of simulations and analyzing those results. The R code would benefit from some refactoring to make it DRYer.
